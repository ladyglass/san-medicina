								Pro-Abortion  Protest  Rocks  the  Suburbs

					<p>About  a  dozen  protesters  marched  outside  of  the  Women’s  Informed  Choice  Center  in  West  Bement  Saturday,  raising  their  voices  against  what  they  perceive  as  a  gross  miscarriage  of  justice.  The  subject  of  their  ire?  Abortion  and  women’s  access  to  it.  
						<br>
						<br>
						Protests  on  the  issue  are  nothing  new.  However,  this  one  is  managing  to  turn  more  than  the  usual  number  of  heads.  The  characters  are  colorful,  their  perspectives  not  what  you  might  expect. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<p><strong>“Hey,  hey!  Ho,  ho!  That  fetus  has  got  to  go!”</strong></p>
					The  Los  Angeles-based  organization  has  filed  paperwork  to  become  a  tax-exempt,  non-profit  religious  corporation.  Calling  itself  The  First  Church  of  Cessation,  their  stated  goal  is  “A  cleaner,  healthier  planet  through  negative  population  growth.”<br><br>
						“Obviously,  we’re  here  at  this  so-called  Choice  Center  to  protest  the  issue  of  abortion,  or  lack  of  it,”  says  Pastor  Kathy,  the  group’s  leader.  
					
					<br><br>Dressed  in  the  cassock  of  a  Catholic  priest,  complete  with  white  collar,  she’s  eager  to  sum  up  the  church’s  views  for  any  potential  listeners.  “Not  having  babies  is  a  passive  solution.  Euthanasia  and  suicide  are  for  more  pro-active  go-getters.  It’s  the  ultimate  sacrifice,  sure,  but  it’s  the  best  thing  you  can  do  to  save  the  planet.”
					<p>The  demonstrators  arrived  shortly  after  9:00  AM,  dressed  mostly  in  black. <br><br> Several  members  of  the  group  rode  together  in  a  hearse.  They  held  signs  with  slogans  such  as  ABORTION  FOR  A  BETTER  TOMORROW,  SODOMY  =  WORLD  PEACE,  and  SUICIDE  IS  THE  SOLUTION.  One  protester,  a  man  wearing  an  oversized  diaper  and  a  skull  mask,  carried  a  mobile  of  dangling  baby  doll  heads. </p>

            <p>The  Los  Angeles-based  organization  has  filed  paperwork  to  become  a  tax-exempt,  non-profit  religious  corporation.  Calling  itself  The  First  Church  of  Cessation,  their  stated  goal  is  “A  cleaner,  healthier  planet  through  negative  population  growth.”</p>

            <p>“Obviously,  we’re  here  at  this  so-called  Choice  Center  to  protest  the  issue  of  abortion,  or  lack  of  it,”  says  Pastor  Kathy,  the  group’s  leader.  Dressed  in  the  cassock  of  a  Catholic  priest,  complete  with  white  collar,  she’s  eager  to  sum  up  the  church’s  views  for  any  potential  listeners.  “Not  having  babies  is  a  passive  solution.  Euthanasia  and  suicide  are  for  more  pro-active  go-getters.  It’s  the  ultimate  sacrifice,  sure,  but  it’s  the  best  thing  you  can  do  to  save  the  planet.”</p>
				<p>  “I  agree  with  some  of  it,  I  guess,”  said  Rachel,  a  hairdresser  who  works  down  the  street.  “I’m  as  pro-choice  as  they  come,  but  I  mean,  I’m  not  sure  what  they’re  going  to  accomplish.  The  suicide  stuff  is  just  going  to  make  people  disagree.  It’s  weird,  but  it  is  more  excitement  than  we  usually  get  around  here.”</p>

        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">“It’s  all  vegan.”</span><p></p></div>Others  had  stronger  opinions.  “It’s  disgusting,  and  they  should  be  ashamed,”  said  an  anonymous  resident.  “I  look  down  that  street  and  you  know  what  I  see?  A  bunch  of  sad,  angry  children  marching  straight  to  Hell.  Pretty  sure  a  couple  are  drag  queens  or  whatever  they  call  themselves  now.  To  call  themselves  a  church  is  a  real  travesty.  And  that  little  dead  girl  statue  is  obscene.  You  put  that  in  the  paper.”</p>

            <p>Another  resident,  who  goes  by  Mondo,  was  more  enthusiastic.  “Oh,  yeah,  this  is  the  coolest  thing  that’s  ever  happened  in  this  little  town,”  he  said.  “There’s  this  dude  over  there  crawling  at  the  back  of  the  march,  oinking  like  a  pig,  and  all  those  vampire-looking  chicks.  It’s  metal,  bro.  That’s  all  I  got  to  say.  That  chili  they’re  giving  out  is  fire,  too.  I  think  it’s  gotta  be  like  Kobe  beef  or  something.”</p>
            <p>Pastor  Kathy  insists  the  food  is  meat-free. “It’s  all  vegan.  Just  because  we’re  anti-human  doesn’t  mean  we’re  pro-death.”</p></div>
        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"></div><p>By  noon,  a  small  crowd  of  onlookers  had  gathered  across  the  street  from  the  protest.  Very  few  spoke  to  demonstrators.  Even  fewer  were  brave  enough  to  try  the  free  chili,  scooped  from  a  witch’s  cauldron  by  a  church  member  with  at  least  a  dozen  facial  piercings. </p>
					<p>“Read  their  signs,”  said  Carletta,  14.  “They  totally  poisoned  the  food.  You  know  they  did.”</p>
					<p>Visitors  to  the  Women’s  Informed  Choice  Center  had  no  choice  but  to  walk  through  the  protest.  Demonstrators  were  quick  to  offer  them  literature.  A  variety  of  pamphlets  were  available,  some  explaining  the  church’s  views  on  suicide,  others  pointing  the  way  to  abortion  clinics  in  the  area. </p>
					<p>“The  Women’s  Informed  Choice  Center  is  a  sham,”explained  Pastor  Kathy.  “The  name  implies  it’s  a  place  that  supports  women,  that  informs  them  and  gives  them  choices.  They  have  billboards  saying  to  call  them  if  you’re  pregnant  and  looking  for  options.  Then  you  get  here,  they  give  you  an  ultrasound  and  tell  you  how  abortion  is  definitely  the  wrong  choice.  It’s  a  classic  bait  and  switch  operation.”</p>

        <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">Afterword </span><p><span class="headline hl4"></span></p></div><p>We  reached  out  to  the  Women’s  Informed  Choice  Center  for  comment.  They  emailed  us  a  statement  that  reads,  in  part,  “We  present  potentially  expectant  mothers  with  a  full  range  of  information  on  all  of  their  choices.  Our  services  are  held  to  high  confidentiality  standards.  We  will  not  discuss  the  lives  or  activities  of  our  patients  online  or  in  print.” </p>
					
					<p>The  protest  was  broken  up  by  police  around  3:00  PM,  when  the  sidewalk  outside  the  Choice  Center  was  sprayed  with  several  gallons  of  what  appeared  to  be  blood.  Church  members  dispersed  peacefully. </p>
					<p>“It’s  corn  syrup  and  food  coloring,”  said  a  protester,  loading  signs  into  the  hearse.  “No  animals  were  harmed  in  the  making  of  this  demonstration.  Save  the  animals!  Kill  yourself!”</p>
